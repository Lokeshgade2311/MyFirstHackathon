Project Title
Optimizing Grocery Stock Selection Using AI-Driven Demand Forecasting

Problem Description:
Grocery stores face challenges in maintaining optimal stock levels due to unpredictable demand, seasonal variations, and external factors (e.g., weather, events, economic conditions). These inefficiencies lead to:

Increased costs and waste from overstocking.
Lost sales and decreased customer satisfaction from understocking.
Goal:
Leverage AI-driven demand forecasting to accurately predict demand, optimize inventory, reduce waste, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Solution Overview
Develop an AI/ML-based solution to analyze trends, seasonal changes, and customer behavior. This solution provides data-driven insights to:

Improve Forecasting Accuracy: Achieve 90%+ accuracy.
Optimize Stock Selection: Reduce stockouts and overstocking by 20%+.
Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Increase satisfaction by 15%+.
Boost Profitability: Achieve a 10%+ increase in profitability.
Core Features
Demand Forecasting: AI models predict item demand.
Inventory Optimization: Suggest stock levels and reorder points.
Trend Analysis: Leverage weather, events, and social media trends.
Real-Time Alerts: Notifications for stockouts and slow-moving items.
Analytics Dashboard: Provide insights into sales, inventory, and customer preferences.
Tech Stack
Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
Models: ARIMA, Linear Regression, LSTM.
Data Storage: PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
Visualization: Streamlit, Tableau, Power BI.
External Data: OpenWeatherMap API, Google Trends API.
Practicality & Impact
Practicality:

Scalable for small to large grocery stores.
Uses modern AI tools (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
Integrates with existing inventory and ERP systems.
Impact:

Minimizes losses from overstocking and unsold perishables.
Ensures availability of high-demand products, boosting sales.
Provides actionable insights to help grocery stores stay competitive.
